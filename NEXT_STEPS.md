# 🎉 Great News! The LLM Issue is Fixed!

Your log shows: `✅ Successfully loaded model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`

The sentencepiece error has been resolved! 🎊

## 🔧 One More Step: Start MeiliSearch

The only remaining issue is that MeiliSearch isn't running yet:

```bash
# Quick fix - start MeiliSearch:
./start_meilisearch.sh

# Or manually:
docker run -d --name meilisearch -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

## 🚀 Then You Can Run:

```bash
# Test everything works:
python test_without_search.py

# Once MeiliSearch is running:
python example.py                    # Full demo
python run.py api                    # Start API server
python run.py process "CHANNEL_URL"  # Process real videos
```

## 🎯 What Just Got Fixed:

✅ **Syntax Error**: Fixed the `elif` without `if` issue
✅ **Sentencepiece**: Added missing dependencies  
✅ **Model Loading**: Mistral model now loads successfully
✅ **Fallback System**: Auto-fallback to simpler models if needed

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues:

```bash
# Check all dependencies:
python check_dependencies.py

# Install any missing ones:
./install_dependencies.sh

# Test core functionality (no MeiliSearch needed):
python test_without_search.py

# See comprehensive help:
cat TROUBLESHOOTING.md
