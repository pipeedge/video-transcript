    Welcome to the Network Security Learning podcast. Today we're talking about penetration testing fundamentals.
    
    Let me start with the OWASP methodology. OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project, and they provide a comprehensive framework for security testing.
    
    One mental model I use is the CIA triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Every security decision should consider these three pillars.
    
    Here's a real story: I once found a SQL injection vulnerability that gave me admin access to a major e-commerce site. The company paid a $50,000 bug bounty for that find.
    
    For actionable advice, always start with automated scanning tools like Nmap and Burp Suite before moving to manual testing.
    
    Remember this quote from Bruce Schneier: "Security is a process, not a product." You need continuous monitoring and improvement.
    
    Some key numbers to remember: 80% of breaches involve weak passwords, and the average data breach costs $4.45 million according to IBM's 2023 report.
