MFM Vault.com (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQtWHOUmqNw&ab_channel=GregKamradt) designed to extract insights, frameworks, and stories from a large podcast series. The creator explains the technical process behind building this tool, starting with downloading and transcribing podcast audio from YouTube. The application then segments the transcripts, enhances their readability using AI, and generates titles for each segment. A fast search function allows users to quickly find specific content and jump to precise timestamps within the original videos. Finally, the system identifies and categorises key insights like quotes and product mentions, even providing related content recommendations based on semantic similarity, all built with AI engineering principles at its core.

You are a professonal developer, your tasks is to build the similar app with MFM with the core functions as follows (use open-sourced LLM first if the instruction provided LLM is not open-sourced):

*   **Segment Hydration – Cleaning Text for Display**:
    *   After the initial transcription from services like Deepgram, which can output text without capitalisation or punctuation, an LLM is used to process this raw text.
    *   The goal is to **"make it a display text"** that is easier for an end-user to read, by adding punctuation and capitalisation.
    *   The creator mentions that Dharesh, who runs the Dares podcast, shared his own prompt for improving transcriptions, and the creator's prompt for this purpose is also available via the link in the description. While the exact prompt isn't provided in the excerpts, it would be an instruction to the LLM to **format raw transcript text for readability, adding punctuation and capitalisation**.

*   **Segment Hydration – Generating Segment Titles**:
    *   For each individual speaking segment, an LLM is queried to generate a concise title. This helps create a "rich process" for understanding the content.
    *   The prompt used is similar to: "**hey if you were to give a title to this segment what would it actually be**". This allows the app to automatically title segments like "Sales work versus content work" or "Live startup investment calls".

*   **Insight Extraction**:
    *   This is a core function for pulling out key information like frameworks, stories, products, and quotes from podcast episodes.
    *   The main prompt mentioned for this is: "**Please read all the following podcast transcripts and extract all the key insites discussed organize them into the following categories**".
    *   **Crucial Tip for Insight Extraction**: To overcome the language model's context length limitations and get more extracted insights, the creator advises to **"Chunk Up the individual transcript"** and run this prompt over every single chunk. Afterwards, a deduplication exercise is performed to handle any overlap.
    *   **Meta Prompting for Categories**: The categories themselves (e.g., Frameworks, Stories, Products, Quotes) were not hardcoded initially. The creator used a "pre-prompt exercise" with another LLM (specifically Claude) to determine these. The prompt for this "meta prompting" was something like: "**hey what do you think that I should or what are the categories you think that I should extract from this podcast**". The creator then added "a little human flavour on top of it" to finalise the categories.

*   **Timestamp Extraction for Insights**:
    *   To enable deep-linking directly to specific moments in a video where an insight or quote was mentioned, an LLM is used to identify the exact start and end times.
    *   The prompt for this is: "**hey llm when was this quote said in the podcast**".
    *   The **transcript, which includes timestamps**, is passed to the LLM, allowing it to return the start and end times in seconds. This allows the app to jump directly to the relevant part of the YouTube video.

It's also worth noting that while LLMs are central to these content transformations and extractions, a similar app would also rely on various other tools and APIs for different functionalities:
*   **Video/Audio Download**: `pytube` for getting episode lists from YouTube channel IDs and `yt-dlp` for downloading videos and extracting audio.
*   **Transcription**: Deepgram's Nova 2 model (with diarization and punctuation enabled) is used for transcribing audio, though others like Assembly or Google's transcription could also be used.
*   **Search**: MeiliSearch provides a fast search index for quickly finding segments and insights, with filtering options by episode or speaker.
*   **Product Information Extraction**: When products are mentioned, the system uses Perplexity and Exa to extract additional product information and link out to them.
*   **Related Insights (Semantic Similarity)**: This feature, for finding semantically similar content across different episodes, doesn't use an LLM prompt directly. Instead, it leverages **PG Vector** in Superbase with a **custom SQL function** (`find_similar_insight`) that compares embeddings (numerical representations of the content) to measure similarity.

Think of these prompts as the detailed "recipes" you give to a highly skilled, intelligent chef (your LLM). While you might have an entire kitchen stocked with specialised appliances (like a high-speed blender for transcription, or a super-fast oven for search), it's the specific, clear instructions in your recipe (the prompt) that tell the chef exactly what ingredients to combine, how to process them, and how to present the final dish to your guests.
